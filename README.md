# Firebase auth lite (alpha)
This is a small package that currently provides very limited functionality. Currently this package only provides functionality for logging-in/out by using email/password authorization.

The goal of the project is to provide all the functionality offered by the official javascript SDK but in a much smaller size by suporting only new browsers.
